My thought on all the sorts is that bubble is the worst when
it comes to almost all the different cases. In term of which
perform the fastest it's certainly quicksort. It dominated
most cases, but couldn't beat insertion on sort array.
Bubble is good when it comes to small sizes and easy to make.
Overall, all the sorts were very interesting in terms of the
logic behind it. I think personally quick and shell is the best
